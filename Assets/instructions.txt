Use the cards below to pick out your feline goon, and if you can afford to hire them, you'll be able to
place them on any available tile occupied by back alley junk! You must choose wisely 
as once they have been placed, you can retire them but do not expect all your money back!
Once you're happy with your set up. Hit space to begin your next battle. Keep an eye on your
ammo stash in the bottom left! Each goon will use up a certain ammo type,so you will have to
stay on top of it to ensure you don't leave your gang defenceless! Upgrade your capacity or refill at a cost.
You may notice that hiring new goons and refilling ammo costs a little more if you're midway through a battle.
Try to avoid those costs by planning ahead during the 'deploy' stage.
